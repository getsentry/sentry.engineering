**We recently released [Cocoa SDK 9.0.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/9.0.0). Learn what's new and what changed.**

The last major release 8.0.0 was published on **January 16, 2023**. After 57 minor and 47 bug fix releases, it's finally time for a new major version to land: **9.0.0**.

## Why now?

Our minimum supported OS versions were **so low** that some users were increasingly reporting Xcode warnings caused by this — a bit too much of [Compatibility is King](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/philosophy/#compatibility-is-king). So it's really time to do a major update and bump the minimum supported OS versions.

## Maintenance Major

V9 is a maintenance major: it focuses on bumping minimum OS versions, enabling a couple of features by default, and addressing many minor API cleanup topics. It should be easy for you to upgrade. — Famous last words.

## Essential Changes

Here is the list of the essential changes:

- We bumped the minimum supported OS versions:
  - iOS: from 11.0 to 15.0
  - tvOS: from 11.0 to 15.0
  - macOS: from 10.13 to 10.14
  - watchOS: from 4.0 to 8.0
  - visionOS: 1.0 (unchanged)
- We now use Xcode 16 for building the precompiled XCFramework, and we set the `swift-tools-version` to 6.0.
- [Structured logs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/logs/) are no longer experimental.
- HTTP client errors now mark sessions as errored. This provides better visibility into failed network requests in the release health data.
- [App Hang Tracking V2](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/configuration/app-hangs/#app-hangs-v2) is now the default for everybody on iOS, tvOS, and macCatalyst.
- [Tracing](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/tracing/): We enabled [pre-warmed app start tracing](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#prewarmed-app-start-tracing) by default, and the app start duration now finishes when the first frame is drawn instead of when the OS posts the `UIWindowDidBecomeVisibleNotification`.
- [Profiling](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/profiling/): we removed the deprecated [transaction-based profiling](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/profiling/#transaction-based-profiling-removed-in-900). You now have to use [UIProfiling](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/profiling/#enable-ui-profiling).
- Compiling from source via SPM works again, but we don’t officially support it yet.
- We dropped support for the hardly maintained package manager [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Our support has been broken for over half a year, actually, and nobody complained. So we officially drop the support. If somebody complains, we can re-add it later.
- We added a new SDK, `SentryDistribution`, that keeps internal builds up to date; it's the Sentry version of Emerge Tools' [ETDistribution](https://github.com/EmergeTools/ETDistribution) 🚀.

The complete list of all changes is long. If you're interested, check out the [migration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/migration/#breaking-changes) or the [9.0.0 changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/9.0.0) to see it.

## How to update?

Simply update your package manager to use the latest version of V9 and then check the [migration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/migration/#breaking-changes) to see if you need to change anything.

## What about version 8?

We have stopped feature development for v8 and will only ship critical bug fixes. You still can use v8 and aren't forced to upgrade to v9, but we still recommend updating to the latest major version if possible.

## It's time to update

Please update and give v9 a try. We're excited to see what you build with it. In case you have problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues) and we'll help you out.
