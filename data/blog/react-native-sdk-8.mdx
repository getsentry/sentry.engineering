**We’ve released [React Native SDK 8](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/releases/tag/8.0.0). The headline feature: you can now capture app start errors and native crashes that occur before JavaScript loads.**

Version 8.0.0 is our first major release since 7.0.0 on September 2, 2025. Between those releases, we shipped 13 minor versions and 2 patch releases.

## What's New?

Version 8 is a **maintenance and capability major release** that introduces two key changes:

1. **App start error capture**: Sentry can now capture crashes and errors during React Native bridge setup, bundle loading, and native module initialization — not just after `Sentry.init()` runs on the JavaScript side. In previous versions, this required complicated configuration and [manual native initialization](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/native-init/). In version 8, you can **initialize Sentry at the native layer** using a `sentry.options.json` configuration file and new native APIs. This allows the SDK to capture app start errors and native crashes from the very beginning of the app lifecycle. You can find more information in the [documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/app-start-error-capture/).

2. **Upgraded native dependencies**: Cocoa SDK v9, Sentry CLI v3, and Android Gradle Plugin v6.

## Changes you should know about

The minimum version requirements have changed.

### Apple Platforms

- **iOS**: 15.0+ (previously 11.0+)
- **macOS**: 10.14+ (previously 10.13+)
- **tvOS**: 15.0+ (previously 11.0+)

### Android

- **Android Gradle Plugin**: 7.4.0+
- **Kotlin**: 1.8+

## Upgrading to version 8

1. Update `@sentry/react-native` to the latest 8.x version in your package manager.
2. Follow the [v7 to v8 migration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/migration/v7-to/v8/) to adjust minimum versions and build configuration (iOS/macOS/tvOS deployment targets, Android Gradle Plugin, Kotlin, and self-hosted Sentry if applicable).
3. Optionally enable [app start error capture](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/app-start-error-capture/) using `sentry.options.json` and native initialization.

## What about version 7?

Version 7 will receive **critical bug fixes only**. We recommend upgrading to v8 to get full native lifecycle coverage, the latest Cocoa and Android improvements, and ongoing support.

## Ready to upgrade?

Give version 8 a try, and enable native initialization if you want full coverage from app launch. If something breaks or doesn’t work as expected, [open an issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/issues) and we’ll help you resolve it.
